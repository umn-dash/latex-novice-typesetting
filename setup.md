For this lesson, you will need an [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) account. A free account will have all of the features you need for the course. Overleaf is a popular online LaTeX editor.

You will also need to download the [refs.bib file](https://umn-dash.github.io/latex-novice-typesetting/data/refs.bib) which will later be uploaded to Overleaf so you can work with citations.
